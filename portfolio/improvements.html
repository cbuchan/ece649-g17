    <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">For each submission, you
    should update this log with a list of ideas or suggestions you have
    for improving the project.&nbsp; This could include identifying bugs
    in the project handouts or documentation, identifying parts of the
    project that were unclear or confusing, and offering ideas for new
    features for the simulator.&nbsp; If you have no suggestions or
    issues for a particular project, add an entry that says "no
    suggestions" or something similar.<br>
    <br>
    Project 1<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Jessica: N/A</li>
      <li>Collin: no suggestions<br>
      </li>
      <li>Jesse: no suggestions</li>
      <li>Rajeev: no suggestions</li>
    </ul>
    Project 2<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Jessica: N/A</li>
      <li>Collin: When making sequence diagrams, it was somewhat unclear
        how to number/trace replicas of the same message (network or
        otherwise). Possibly include an example that demonstrates
        reasonable behavior for such a situation. <br>
      </li>
      <li>Jesse: <br>
        <br>
        - In the Requirements 1 document, the table in the "Controller
        Messages" section should also indicate all destination node
        names for each message listed. As of now, it only indicates the
        source node names for each message. <br>
        <br>
        - In the Requirements 2 document, the "DriveControl" section
        indicates "mDrive" as an output interface, but no other section
        indicates "mDrive" as an input. This would also be more obvious
        if the previous improvement was implemented (it would be noticed
        in the table in the Requirements 1 document). The use for
        "mDrive" should be more obvious.</li>

    <p>Project 3<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Collin: <br>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>Requirements I lists mDoorMotorCommand[b,r] as a valid
          message, but in Requirements II, the only listed output
          interfaces are DoorMotor[b,r] and mDoorMotor[b,r].</li>
        <li>Behavior 4.8 in Requirements II is listed as 4.6 (duplicate)</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Jesse:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Requirement 2.6 is missing a gte symbol</li>
        <li>There is no Level Sensor in the architecture document<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Rajeev: N/A</li>
      <li>Jessica: N/A<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    Project 4<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Jessica: N/A</li>
      <li>Collin: N/A</li>
      <li>Jesse: <br>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>Constraint 6.5 traces to our BR5.10, which is indicated in
          req_const_traceability.html; Perhaps this could be made more
          obvious;&nbsp;</li>
        <li>The Level sensor should be included in the architecture<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Rajeev: N/A</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Project 5<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Jessica: unit tests need to have better documentation; also to
        assert a state value, need to have both "A S" in context. this
        is not mentioned in the simulator usage.</li>
