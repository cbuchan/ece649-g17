<h2><a name="topreq"></a> Elevator High-Level Requirements </h2>
R-T1.&nbsp; All passengers shall eventually be delivered to their
intended destination floor.<br>
R-T2.&nbsp; Any unsafe condition shall cause an emergency stop.<br>
R-T3.&nbsp; An emergency stop should never occur.<br>
R-T4.&nbsp; Performance shall be optimized to the extent possible,
where performance is defined by the formula: <b><br>
</b>
<ul>
  <li> <b>( 4 * average_passenger_delivery_time) +&nbsp;
maximum_passenger_delivery_time</b> </li>
  <li>Performance is improved by reducing that value (short delivery
times are better).&nbsp;&nbsp; Delivery time is counted from the time a
passenger arrives at a floor to begin a trip and ends when that
passenger exits the elevator car.&nbsp; (Note: this is an arbitrary
formula for this project, but the general idea holds true for real
elevators.) </li>
</ul>
R-T5.&nbsp; Passenger satisfaction shall be optimized to the extent
possible, where satisfaction is defined by the formula:<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">( 4 *
average_passenger_satisfaction) + minimum_passenger_satisfaction</span><br>
  </li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> The full set of example
requirements provided should result in an elevator with safe behavior
that meets top-level requirements other than having poor optimization
of performance.&nbsp; While it is obvious that the Dispatcher behavior
can be optimized, there are also other, more subtle, behavioral
optimizations possible as well.<br>
<h2><a name="buildingdesc"></a> Building description </h2>
The Building the elevator is in has floors numbered from 1 ..
MaxFloor.&nbsp; In this case, MaxFloor = 8<br>
<br>
The setup of hallway entrances is as follows:<br>

<br>
"FH" is a shorthand for front hallway, and "BH" is a shorthand for back
hallway&nbsp; Floor #1, the lobby, is the lowest floor in the building.<br>
<h2><a name="notation"></a> Notation </h2>
<h3><a name="repnotation"></a> Replication Notation </h3>
<ul>
  <li>f - floor, 1-8 </li>
  <li>b - hallway, FRONT or BACK </li>
  <li>r - side, LEFT or RIGHT </li>
  <li>d - direction, UP or DOWN<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p> "[...]" indicates an array of objects or values.&nbsp;&nbsp; There
are 10 valid hallways, and so there are 17 separate and distinct
HallCall[f, b, d] sensors -- 2 of them at each valid hallway, except
for the top and bottom floors which only have 1 sensor per valid
hallway. </p>
<p> "(...)" indicates a list of values associated with a
sensor/actuator.&nbsp; Single-valued inputs/outputs can have the "("
and ")" omitted as a notational convenience.<br>
</p>
<p> The suffixes "_up", "_down", "_front", and "_back" may be used in
lieu of a direction subscript, to make things more readable. e.g.:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HallCall_up[f, b] means
HallCall[f, b, up]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HallCall_down[f, b] means
HallCall[f, b, down]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HallCall_front[f, d] means
HallCall[f, front, d]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HallCall_back[f, d] means
HallCall[f, back, d]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HallCall_up_front[f] means
HallCall[f, front, up]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and so on...<br>
</p>
<p> Similarly, subscripting may be eliminated in general if desired
using an underscore notation. e.g.:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CarLantern_down means
CarLantern[down]<br>
</p>
<p> Multi-attributed items may have a particular state referred to by
concatenating elements, e.g.: Motor might have state FastUp or
SlowDown. ("StopStop" can always be abbreviated by "Stop") </p>
<p> Single attributes of a multi-attribute item are referred to using
"." notation.&nbsp; For example DesiredFloor.f refers to attribute "f"
of "DesiredFloor". </p>
<p> If a letter instead of a value is used in a subscript, it is
assumed that it can take any valid value.&nbsp; If the same letter is
used in multiple clauses within a single requirement element, it is
assumed that the letter takes the same value in all instances.&nbsp;
For example, in the phrase:<br>
&nbsp;"AtFloor[f, b] ... CarCall[f, b]&nbsp; ...&nbsp; HallCall[g, b,
d]"<br>
The Floor f and Hallway b for AtFloor and CarCall can be any valid
floor and valid hallway, but would have to be the same floor and
hallway.&nbsp; However, the floor for HallCall might or might not be
the same floor as for AtFloor and CarCall since it is a different
symbolic letter. </p>
<h3><a name="repsd"></a> Replication in Sequence Diagrams </h3>
<p> Replication is a problem in UML Sequence Diagrams. Rather than
introducing an attempt at formal notation (which gets very confusing
quickly), we will resort to using comments when multiple instances of
something are supposed to be coordinated (e.g., "wait for all doors to
close" will be a text comment in Sequence Diagrams, but shall be
represented rigorously in behavioral requirements).<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="repreqs"></a> Replication in Behavioral Requirements </h3>
<p> Because the controllers are written in a generic way, it's
important to pay attention to the way the replication notation is used
in the behavioral requirements.&nbsp; Here are some general guidelines:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>"set mDoorMotor[b,r] to CLOSE" - refers to the particular
mDoorMotor output for hallway b, side r. </li>
  <li>"if any mDoorMotor[b,r] is set to CLOSE" - this statement would
be considered true if any of the four door motor messages (front-left,
front-right, back-left, back-right) were set to CLOSE. </li>
  <li>"if all mDoorMotor[b,r] are set to CLOSE" - considered true if
all four door motors were set to CLOSE </li>
  <li>"if any mDoorReversal[b,*] is true" - use the star notation to
denote replication in one dimension but not another.&nbsp; This
statement would be considered true either the left or right door
reversal on the b hallway of the car was true.&nbsp; This notation does
    <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> check the door
reversals on the opposite hallway. </li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="init"></a> Initialization<br>
</h2>
<p> Because ultimately we will do this all in simulation, we're going
to make your life easy by telling you the initial state of the system
(the "initialization" state) such as putting the elevator car at the
lobby floor with the doors closed.&nbsp; In a real elevator the
controllers have to figure out the system state for themselves when
power is applied.<br>
</p>
<h2><a name="systemelements"></a> System Elements </h2>
This section describes the elements of the system that are already
provided<br>
<h3><a name="car"></a> The Car
</h3>
The notation "Car" refers to the elevator Car that travels in a
hoistway.&nbsp; The movement of the Car itself is hidden within the
environment model, so it can only be observed through sensors and
controlled through actuators.<br>
<h3><a name="physicalsensors"></a> Physical State Sensors </h3>
These objects are instantiate in the system but do not have a network
interface.&nbsp; These objects must be read through the physical
interface of a controller.<br>
<ul>
  <li> <b>CarCall[f, b](v)</b>: Car Call buttons.&nbsp; v = {True,
False}. </li>
  <li
 style="list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; list-style-position: outside; display: inline;">
    <ul>
      <li>One per Floor and Hallway [f, b] combination, all located in
the CAR.&nbsp; No button object is instantiated for [f,b] combinations
where there is no landing. </li>
      <li>CarCall objects do not send network messages. </li>
      <li>Set to False at initialization. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> <b>HallCall[f, b, d](v)</b>: Hall Call buttons.&nbsp;&nbsp; v =
{Pressed, Idle}.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>One per Floor, Hallway, and Direction [f, b, d] combination,
all located in the hallways. No button is instantiated for floors that
have no landing.&nbsp; Also, the topmost floor does not have Up
buttons; bottommost floor does not have Down buttons. </li>
      <li>HallCall objects do not send network messages. </li>
      <li>Set to False at initialization. </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <b>DriveSpeed(s,d)</b>: main drive speed readout.&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>s</i>
is speed s = {double 0 .. } in meters/sec <i>d</i> is direction d =
{Up, Down, Stop}
    <ul>
      <li>One per Car. </li>
      <li>Provides information about the current drive speed set by
Drive(s,d) !! but this is the actual drive status rather than the
status commanded by Drive(s,d).&nbsp; (Note that there will be a time
delay between commanding the drive to change speed and the drive
actually attaining that speed.&nbsp; This lets you know when the
commanded speed is actually attained.) </li>
      <li>Initialized to (0, Stop). </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="smartsensors"></a> Smart Sensors </h3>
These sensor values are available for use by the control system.&nbsp;
The below-listed values will correspond to network messages in the
implementation phase.<br>
Note:&nbsp; If an object that sends a network message is not
instantiated (such as an atFloor sensor at a [f,b] without a landing),
then no network message with that CAN id is ever sent.<br>
<ul>
  <li> <b>AtFloor[f, b](v)</b>: Floor proximity sensor.&nbsp;&nbsp; v
= {True, False}.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>One per Floor and Hallway [f, b] combination. </li>
      <li>Indicates True at a point where the Car is approximately
level with floor f.&nbsp; If there is no landing at a particular
hallway on a particular floor, then no sensor is instantiated for that
landing, so no network messages will be sent.&nbsp; For example, there
is a back landing but no front landing at the second floor, so an
AtFloor[2,back] sensor will be instantiated, but an AtFloor[2,front]
sensor will not be instantiated.&nbsp; It is assumed that the width of
the Stop zone is such that the Drive has enough time to switch from
going at Slow speed to Stop and still have the car level with the
floor. </li>
      <li
 style="list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; list-style-position: outside; display: inline;">
        <ul>
          <li>Set to False at initialization, except the lobby switch
is set to True at initialization. </li>
          <li>AtFloor[f, b] shall be set True if and only if
CarPosition is within 150 msec of travel time of floor position f at
Slow speed in either direction and there is a hallway at [f, b].</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:&nbsp; the AtFloor
sensor will not be triggered if the car is going faster than Slow.</span><br>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> <b>CarLevelPosition(x)</b>: Car position sensor.&nbsp; x =
{integer 0 .. } in millimeters<br>
    <ul>
      <li>One per Car. </li>
      <li>Reports approximate position of car in hoistway based on
position sensors placed at 10 cm intervals in the hoistway.&nbsp; Gets
updated each time the car passes one of these sensors. </li>
      <li>Set to Lobby position at initialization. &nbsp; </li>
    </ul>
&nbsp; </li>
  <li> <b>DoorClosed[b, r](v)</b>: Door Closed switches.&nbsp;&nbsp; v
= {True, False}.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>One per Door [b, r] for b = {Front, Back} and r = {Left,
Right}. </li>
      <li>Indicates True when the Door[b, r] is fully closed. </li>
      <li>Set to True at initialization. </li>
      <li>DoorClosed[b, r] shall be True if and only if DoorPosition[b,
r] has a value less than 1. </li>
    </ul>
&nbsp; </li>
  <li> <b>DoorOpened[b, r](v)</b>: Door Opened switches.&nbsp;&nbsp; v
= {True, False}.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>One per Door [b, r] for b = {Front, Back} and r = {Left,
Right}. </li>
      <li>Indicates True when the Door[b, r] is fully open. </li>
      <li>Set to False at initialization. </li>
      <li>DoorOpened[b, r] shall be True if and only if DoorPosition[b,
r] has a value greater than 490. </li>
    </ul>
&nbsp; </li>
  <li> <b>DoorReversal[b, r](v)</b>: Door Reversal
sensors.&nbsp;&nbsp; v = {True, False}.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>One per Door [b, r] for b = {Front, Back} and r = {Left,
Right}. </li>
      <li>Indicates True whenever the Door [b, r] senses an obstruction
in the doorway. </li>
      <li>Set to False at initialization.&nbsp; </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Level[d](v)</span>:&nbsp;
Leveling sensors.&nbsp; v = {True, False}.&nbsp; These sensors allow
for more accurate leveling of the car.<br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>One per direction, affixed to the car a fixed distance above
and below the car.</li>
    <li>In addition to the sensors, there is a leveling vane at every
floor.&nbsp; The leveling vane is a protrusion that is exactly centered
on the floor position.<br>
    </li>
    <li>The leveling sensors are beam sensors.&nbsp; When the car is
level, one sensor is above the vane and the other is below.&nbsp; Since
the vane does not obstruct either sensor, both read true.&nbsp; If the
car is out of level, one or the other of the sensors will be blocked by
the vane and read false.</li>
    <li>The width of the vane and position of the level sensors is
configures so that when the atFloor[f,b] sensor becomes true (as the
car approaches the floor), one of the leveling sensors will already be
blocked.&nbsp; Thus, if any mAtFloor[f,b] is true and both leveling
sensors are true, the car is level.</li>
    <li>When the car is at a floor and both sensors are true, the level
error is less than or equal to 5mm.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>HoistwayLimit[d](v)</b>: Safety limit switches in the
hoistway.&nbsp;&nbsp; v = {True, False}. One pair per Car, d = {Up,
Down}.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>A HoistwayLimit[d] switch activates when the car has over-run
the hoistway limits (used as a trigger for emergency stopping). The
d=Up switch is at top of hoistway; d=Down switch is at bottom of
hoistway. </li>
      <li>Set to False at initialization. </li>
    </ul>
&nbsp; </li>
  <li> <b>CarWeight(x)</b>: Car weight sensor.&nbsp;&nbsp; x = {int 0
.. } in tenths of pounds (lbs)&nbsp;
    <ul>
      <li>One per Car. </li>
      <li>Provides information about current total weight of passengers
in the car in tenths of pounds (lbs). &nbsp; The car weight sensor
shall not be affected by the acceleration/deceleration of the car.
&nbsp; MaxCarCapacity is the maximum allowable weight for safe travel
in car. </li>
      <li>CarWeight is set to 0 at initialization. (Car is empty)<br>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> <span style="font-weight: bold;">CarWeightAlarm(v):</span> v =
{True, False} </li>
  <li
 style="list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; list-style-position: outside; display: inline;">
    <ul>
      <li>One per Car </li>
      <li>Provides information about the status of the buzzer.&nbsp;
The buzzer rings any time the car is overweight. </li>
      <li>Set to false at initialization<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="environlystate"></a> Environmental-Only System State: </h3>
These values keep track of current system state.&nbsp; They are not
accessible to the
control system, but have been used in the specifications for building
the simulation system.<br>
<ul>
  <li> <b>DoorPosition[b, r](x)</b>: Amount that the door is
open.&nbsp;&nbsp; x = {integer 0 .. 500} </li>
  <li
 style="list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; list-style-position: outside; display: inline;">
    <ul>
      <li>One per Door [b, r] for b = {Front, Back} and r = {Left,
Right}. </li>
      <li>Value is the amount the door is open as a thousandth of
doorway width.&nbsp; Each DoorPosition[b, r] can range from 0 to
500.&nbsp; With both Door_Front[r] open at 500 the entire front doorway
is opened overall. With both Door_Back[r] open at 500 the entire back
doorway is opened overall. </li>
      <li>Set to 0 at initialization (front doors closed). </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> <b>CarPosition(x)</b>: Vertical position of car.&nbsp;&nbsp; x

floor number or CarLevelPosition). </li>
      <li>Set to Lobby position at initialization. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="sysactuators"></a> System Actuators </h3>
The below-listed values will correspond to network messages in the
implementation phase.&nbsp; All actuators are assumed to "remember"
their last commanded value and stay there unless commanded otherwise or
forced otherwise by system/environment constraints.<br>
<ul>
  <li> <b>DoorMotor[b, r](m)</b>: Door motor.&nbsp;&nbsp; m = {Open,
Close, Nudge, Stop} </li>

    <ul>
      <li>One per Door [b, r] for b = {Front, Back} and r = {Left,
Right}. </li>
      <li>Opens and closes the door.&nbsp; It is permissible to
transition directly from Open to Close, Open to Nudge, Nudge to Open,

DriveSpeed(s,d) and is not necessarily the same as the Drive command
because of the acceleration profile.</li>
      <li>While the drive is stopped, if the car weight changes, the
car may move downward as a result of cable slip.<br>

    <li>Buzzer that sounds when the CarWeight sensor detects that the
elevator

      <li>Supplies emergency braking in case of safety violation such
as hoistway limit over-run or movement with doors open. One per
Car.&nbsp; Can be used exactly one time, after which elevator hoistway
requires significant repair maintenance.&nbsp; Triggering the
EmergencyBrake in simulation means that either a safety-critical
sensor/actuator has been broken or your elevator controller has
attempted unsafe operation.&nbsp; (If the EmergencyBrake activates
during your final project demo due to an attempt of unsafe operation,
there will be a scoring penalty.) </li>

<h3><a name="controlobj"></a>Control System Objects </h3>
In addition to the objects described above, there are several complex
control system objects.&nbsp; These objects are summarized below.&nbsp;
The detailed specification of these objects can be found in the <a
 href="requirements2.html">Behavioral Requirements II</a>
document.&nbsp;
Environmental objects have already been designed and are provided by
the system.&nbsp; The other control objects will be the primary focus
of your design effort.<br>
<ul>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li>Passenger (environmental) - the simulated passenger that
interacts with the physical interface of the elevator<br>
  </li>
  <li>Safety Sensor (environmental) - monitors the system state and
triggers the emergency brake if an unsafe condition is detected. </li>
  <li>Drive (environmental) - moves the car according to the Drive
commands and the elevator acceleration profile. </li>
  <li>DoorMotor[b,r] (environmental) - moves the doors according to the
DoorMotor commands. </li>
  <li>DoorControl[b,r] - controls the motion of the doors<br>
  </li>
  <li>DriveControl - controls the motion of the car </li>
  <li>LanternControl[d] - controls a the direction lanterns </li>
  <li>HallButtonControl[f,b,d] - controls the hall lights and and
monitors hall buttons at the landings </li>
  <li>CarButtonControl[f,b] - controls the car lights and and monitors
car buttons inside the car </li>
  <li>CarPositionControl - controls the output of the car position
indicator </li>
  <li>Dispatcher - determines the order in which floors and hallways
are serviced<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<ul>
</ul>
<h2><a name="messagedictionary"></a> Network Message Dictionary </h2>
This section defines the network messages that may be sent.&nbsp; The
design MUST follow the message dictionary.&nbsp; Following the message
dictionary means:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Every message defined in the message dictionary is sent. </li>
  <li>No message <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> defined
in the message dictionary is sent. </li>
  <li>Each message carries the information described in the dictionary.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="enviromessages"></a>Environmental Object Messages</h3>
These messages are sent by environmental objects and smart sensors
provided in the system<br>

*mDesiredDwell:<br>
<ul>
  <li>There is a separate message for the Front and Back floor.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>This is an optional way for the Dispatcher to override any dwell
time used by the DoorController[b]. </li>
</ul>
**mDesiredFloor:<br>
<b></b>
<ul>
  <li>The dispatcher uses this to indicate the next floor to stop
at.&nbsp; A direction of&nbsp; Stop means that there is no preferred
direction.&nbsp; Directions of Up and Down have the implication that
the next direction the elevator will move in is up or down,
respectively.&nbsp; </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:&nbsp; the value of desired
direction is not necessarily the current direction of motion.&nbsp; The
car may be moving Up with a desired direction of Down, which means that
the elevator will go down after it stops at a floor.</span> </li>
  <li>The value of DesiredFloor may change dynamically and
non-monotonically.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Once doors begin opening the elevator is committed to perform a
full door cycle operation. </li>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">The <span style="font-style: italic;">f</span>
