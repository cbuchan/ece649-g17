    <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">For each submission, you
    should update this log with a list of ideas or suggestions you have
    for improving the project.&nbsp; This could include identifying bugs
    in the project handouts or documentation, identifying parts of the
    project that were unclear or confusing, and offering ideas for new
    features for the simulator.&nbsp; If you have no suggestions or
    issues for a particular project, add an entry that says "no
    suggestions" or something similar.<br>
    <br>
    Project 1<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Jessica: N/A</li>
      <li>Collin: no suggestions<br>
      </li>
      <li>Jesse: no suggestions</li>
      <li>Rajeev: no suggestions</li>
    </ul>
    Project 2<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Jessica: N/A</li>
      <li>Collin: When making sequence diagrams, it was somewhat unclear
        how to number/trace replicas of the same message (network or
        otherwise). Possibly include an example that demonstrates
        reasonable behavior for such a situation. <br>
      </li>
      <li>Jesse: <br>
        <br>
        - In the Requirements 1 document, the table in the "Controller
        Messages" section should also indicate all destination node
        names for each message listed. As of now, it only indicates the
        source node names for each message. <br>
        <br>
        - In the Requirements 2 document, the "DriveControl" section
        indicates "mDrive" as an output interface, but no other section
        indicates "mDrive" as an input. This would also be more obvious
        if the previous improvement was implemented (it would be noticed
        in the table in the Requirements 1 document). The use for
        "mDrive" should be more obvious.</li>

    <p>Project 3<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Collin: <br>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>Requirements I lists mDoorMotorCommand[b,r] as a valid
          message, but in Requirements II, the only listed output
          interfaces are DoorMotor[b,r] and mDoorMotor[b,r].</li>
        <li>Behavior 4.8 in Requirements II is listed as 4.6 (duplicate)</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Jesse:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Requirement 2.6 is missing a gte symbol</li>
        <li>There is no Level Sensor in the architecture document<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Rajeev: N/A</li>
      <li>Jessica: N/A<br>

    </ul>
    Project 4<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Jessica: N/A</li>
      <li>Collin: N/A</li>
      <li>Jesse: <br>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>Constraint 6.5 traces to our BR5.10, which is indicated in
          req_const_traceability.html; Perhaps this could be made more
          obvious;&nbsp;</li>
        <li>The Level sensor should be included in the architecture<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Rajeev: N/A</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Project 5<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Jessica: unit tests need to have better documentation; also to
        assert a state value, need to have both "A S" in context. this
        is not mentioned in the simulator usage.</li>
      <li>Collin: N/A<br>
      </li>
      <li>Jesse: <br>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>File
          http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ece649/project/codebase/development-overview.html,




          section "Reporting Controller State" says "A string key,
          Controll.STATE_KEY has been provided for this purpose". This
          section should indicate WHERE this has been provided to
          require less overhead of readers. <br>
        </li>
        <li>File TestLight.java should include 1-line comments beneath
          each subsection of "*Declarations" indicating which imported
          package the declaration utilizes (to help re-iterate the
          structure of the simulator to those reading the code, since
          TestLight.java is a learning experience). <br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Rajeev: N/A</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Project 6<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Jessica: N/A</li>
      <li>Collin: The automatically generated stats file for
        unit/integration/acceptance tests should have only added
        suffixes to the test file name, not prefixes. This would
        maintain a more intuitive name sorting in file systems as
        prefixes destroy alphanumeric sorting. (i.e. DoorControl.cf,
        DoorControl_01.mf, DoorControl_01.mf-0.stats should all
        associate, injection-DoorControl_01.mf-0.stats is redundant and
        does not associate) <br>
      </li>
      <li>Jesse: <br>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>The unit test folder should include a template file that
          exemplifies the use of many (if not all) possible .mf
          commands, with comments that a.) describe each command in
          word-form (e.g. context, message type, params), and b.) lists
          the files referenced in finding IDs and or formats. Even
          providing just a bunch of well-commented irrelevant example
          code-lines for the .mf files would be fine.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Handin and simulator instructions seem to cascade themselves
          along the paper-trail of project instructions. For example,
          instructions for using the test_verify.sh script are in
          Project 5 instructions, and not in Project 6 instructions.
          There should at least be an index of some form listed on each
          project's instructions page.<br>
