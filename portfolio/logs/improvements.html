    <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">For each submission, you
    should update this log with a list of ideas or suggestions you have
    for improving the project.&nbsp; This could include identifying bugs
    in the project handouts or documentation, identifying parts of the
    project that were unclear or confusing, and offering ideas for new
    features for the simulator.&nbsp; If you have no suggestions or
    issues for a particular project, add an entry that says "no
    suggestions" or something similar.<br>

    Project 1<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Jessica: N/A</li>
      <li>Collin: no suggestions<br>
      </li>
      <li>Jesse: no suggestions</li>
      <li>Rajeev: no suggestions</li>
    </ul>
    Project 2<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Jessica: N/A</li>
      <li>Collin: When making sequence diagrams, it was somewhat unclear
        how to number/trace replicas of the same message (network or
        otherwise). Possibly include an example that demonstrates
        reasonable behavior for such a situation. <br>
      </li>
      <li>Jesse: <br><br>
		- In the Requirements 1 document, the table in the "Controller 
		Messages" section should also indicate all destination 
		node names for each message listed. As of now, it only 
		indicates the source node names for each message. <br><br>
		- In the Requirements 2 document, the "DriveControl" section
		indicates "mDrive" as an output interface, but no other 
		section indicates "mDrive" as an input. This would also
		be more obvious if the previous improvement was 
		implemented (it would be noticed in the table in the 
		Requirements 1 document). The use for "mDrive" 
		should be more obvious.</li><br>
