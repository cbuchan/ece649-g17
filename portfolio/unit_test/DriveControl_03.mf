; Unit test for DriveControl

; Note: Assertions must be inserted more than two periods after a message
;       or physical value has been inserted to be sure that the change 
;       propagates through the system.

; Note: This test file demonstrates network/framework message injections
;       and network/framework/controller state assertions.
